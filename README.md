# âŒ› Hourly

Hourly is a nice little setup for creating multimedia applications in C++17.

## Requirements

* `cmake`
* `SFML >= v2`
* `make` _(optional unless you want an easier build process)_

## Build and run

Hourly comes with a Makefile that will run those annoyingly long cmake commands for you!

Commands:
  * `make develop`
  * `make run`
